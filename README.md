## Assignment
Decades ago, scientists began to realize the ongoing, persistent declines of fisheries on a global scale. In order to evaluate the quantitative evidence behind this result, this repository uses general data assessment of global fisheries stock and collapse over the past decacdes. It uses large-scale relational database containing multiple tables to construct a time series fisheries assessment. All work for this project in the assignment directory. Code is contained in the fish-assignment.Rmd notebook and final rendered output files are in the assignment directory as well. We are able to visualize total quantity of fish landings over time as well as the collapse status of global fish stock. All of these testify the massive impact unsustainable fishery had on global fish stocks and call for proper policymaking and regulation.
